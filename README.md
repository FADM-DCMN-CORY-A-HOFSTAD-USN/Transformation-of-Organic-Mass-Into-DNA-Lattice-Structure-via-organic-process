After the process of death, cells with your DNA continue to reproduce, while many cells decay. The transfer of genetic material from decaying protein in your corpse to surviving cells contains your genetic information. The genetic code of your being is transferred to any organic matter which comes into contact with your decay. Cells from your decaying corpse can grow on other organic matter.
